## ng-repeat

A type of directive. It is a way of looping over our data and showing the result of such looping on the view. 

ng-repeat also allows us to access the index of the loop by using the $index service inside of the body of the html text.

Also another cool thing, is that ng-repeat sets up watchers for our list, performing 2 way binding. That means that we can change items in the list via our UI like an input field, and also, changes made in the controller will be updated in the UI as well! 

Behaves very similar to foreach construct.
